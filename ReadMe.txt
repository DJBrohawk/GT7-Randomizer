READ ME
Version 1.0

Hello! Welcome to DJ Brohawk's GT7 randomizer app. Firstly, since this readme is quite long, if there are any comments, questions, or concerns, I can be found on Twitter @DJBrohawk! :)

With this app, you'll be able to do a number of things:

1) Pick a random GT3 car, GT4 car, OR a car from a list of your own creation (more on that below)
2) Pick a random track, complete with options for randomizing the following:
	A) Number of laps
	B) Fuel Use Multiplier
	C) Tire Use Multiplier
	D) Category
	E) Starting Time of Day
	F) Time Multiplier
	G) Start Type (As in grid or rolling) - with a random distance if rolling start
3) Generate a random car for everyone in your race!

This app uses the included files "Gr3List.txt", "Gr4List.txt", "CustomList.txt", "CategoryList.txt" and "TrackList.txt" which you can modify yourself if you wish to subtract cars from the list (namely, THE UNDRIVEABLE MR GROUP 3 CARS) or add to them as GT7 introduces new cars, tracks, or categories. You can add anything to these lists, this program isn't all that smart, so be careful modifying the files. That means keep your Brazzers search categories to yourself!

I have it currently set to where the most recent 5 cars and tracks chosen will not be repeated. I did not apply this restriction to the categories.

In the future, I might add a checkbox or variable to change this! :)

---GENERATING A RANDOM CAR FOR EVERYONE---

To generate a random car for everyone in your race, you'll have to add drivers individually using the "Add Driver" button. Once you've added everyone in your race, click one of the Generate Race buttons to assign a random car to everyone in the list.

---GENERATING A RANDOM TRACK---

To generate a random track, fill out the settings and checkboxes on the right hand side to modify the random generation to your liking, and then click the "Generate Random Track" button. If the checkboxes on the right are not checked, those settings will not be taken into account in the random generation.

Note that it is possible for fuel and tire wear to randomly be set to "Off" in addition to a random value within the bounds of what you set.

---ADDING CARS/TRACKS/ETC---

To add a car to the pool of cars or tracks to be chosen, open any of "Gr3List.txt", "Gr4List.txt", "CustomList.txt", "CategoryList.txt", or "TrackList.txt" in the root directory of the application, and then modify the file as you wish. Be sure to only put one name per line. For example:

Audi R8
Lamborghini Aventador
Ferrari 458

Feel free to add or delete whatever you'd like from the files. I have included separately named base text files for Group 3, Group 4, and the tracks that you can copy/paste from if you want to start fresh.

---DELETING DRIVERS FROM THE DRIVER LIST---

The list on the right has the ability to delete multiple drivers or clear the whole list. To delete a single or multiple drivers, simply left click (or hold down shift or control while left clicking to select multiple) and then click the "Delete Driver" button. This will delete the drivers and adjust the remaining drivers in the list automatically. You can delete the whole list by clicking the "Delete All" button.

---OTHER THOUGHTS---

I did not include any of the dirt tracks in my Track List due to that potentially being a mess, although you can always add them to the track list yourself and add dirt-worthy cars to a custom list ;)

This app was inspired by ideas tossed around between myself and some the friends I've made through several GT content creators' communities, most notably EERIEISSS and Tidgney. If you haven't checked them out, please do so. Both great fellows!

Have fun! :)

---POTENTIAL FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS---

Don't know if I'll end up doing these, but they're here in the event somebody wants to.

1) Not making everything text file reliant and instead having separate forms for the cars that have checkboxes for which ones are included in the searches, with filters for categories and stats included

2) Having an adjustable number of cars/tracks that don't repeat
